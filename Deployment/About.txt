About iTCH
==========
iTCH allows you to remotely control the Windows version of iTunes from different computers.  It consists of an iTunes plug-in (Windows only) and a client application (multi-platform).

The iTunes plug-in, STiTCH, operates as a server application, receiving commands from the client and applying them to iTunes.  STiTCH is a Windows only program that runs in the Windows task tray, and can be configured to display notifications whenever a client connection is accepted.

The client application, PiTCH, is capable of remotely controlling iTunes.  It provides controls for displaying and manipulating player state.  PiTCH supports both Windows and Linux/UNIX operating systems.

Components of the iTCH project make use of the Qt cross-platform application and UI framework from Nokia (LGPL version) and the Protocol Buffers library from Google.  The STiTCH plug-in for iTunes uses Apple's iTunes COM for Windows SDK.

iTCH is an open source project made freely available under the terms of the OSI approved MIT License.  See License.txt for details.
